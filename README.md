# Data Skills Workshop

This _brief_ workshop is intended to encourage others to think about and play with data, using Python as a facilitation tool. This workshop is not meant to create experts, represent the QEP/Data Nexus, or serve as a rulebook. 

Everyone brings something unique to this conversation, whether newcomer or pro. We are here to learn from one another.

# Getting Started
We will use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab?path=notebooks%2FIntro.ipynb) to explore the examples on the board. 

Pick a group, run the Notebook, and we'll get started!
