# Data Skills Workshop

This _brief_ workshop is intended to encourage others to think about and play with data, using Python as a facilitation tool. This workshop is not meant to create experts, represent the QEP/Data Nexus, or serve as a rulebook. 

Everyone brings something unique to this conversation, whether newcomer or pro. We are here to learn from one another.

# Getting Started
We will use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab?path=notebooks%2FIntro.ipynb) to explore the examples on the board. 

Pick a group, run the Notebook, and we'll get started!

A few introductory files will populate automatically once you click on the Jupyter link. You can explore these if desired. To complete the exercises on the board, go to _File_ -> _New_ -> _New Notebook_. We are using the _Python (Pyodide)_ kernel. 

# Finding Help
At some point, you will come across something that doesn't quite make sense, and/or you will need to look something up. 

Talk to your group, and I'll be walking around the room as we work through the exercises together. Other options include:
- Google it - I recommend results from places like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- Browse the [Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html), probably in particular [Built-In Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
- Call the `help()` function, which pulls up the manual
  - For example, `help(print)` displays a defintion of the function `print()`
- Ask an AI tool (like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) or [Bard](https://bard.google.com/)) to explain a block of code to you

Last, if you're getting an error, read the full message for any clues.
