# Data Skills Workshop

This _brief_ workshop is intended to encourage others to think about and play with data, using Python as a facilitation tool. This workshop is not meant to create experts, represent the QEP/Data Nexus, or serve as a rulebook. 

Everyone brings something unique to this conversation, whether newcomer or pro. We are here to learn from one another.

# Getting Started
We will use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab?path=notebooks%2FIntro.ipynb) to explore the examples on the board. 

Pick a group, run the Notebook, and we'll get started!

A few introductory files will populate automatically once you click on the Jupyter link. You can explore these if desired. To complete the exercises on the board, go to _File_ -> _New_ -> _New Notebook_. We are using the _Python (Pyodide)_ kernel. 

# Finding Help
At some point, you will come across something that doesn't quite make sense, and/or you will need to look something up. Talk through problems with your group, and I'll be walking around as we work through the exercises together. The following options may also be of use:
* The `help()` function pulls up the manual
* [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html), in particular [Built-In Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
* Google it and pick an answer from [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/)/[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
