That is, `office_NUMBER` is not the same thing as `office_number`)\n- divided_by_underscores (if there are multiple words)\n\nLast, you cannot start a variable name with a number, though you can use numbers within a variable name.

Let's say we are interested in writing a set of instructions that shows the current temperature in Fahrenheit, then converts it to Celsius. What needs to happen in this program? \n\nStepping back and taking a minute to think about what needs to happen is actually [part of the coding process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub). Can you create an outline of your hypothetical program? If your program needs to do several things, what order should they occur in? Breaking things down into smaller parts isn't just a way to tackle problems - it also helps you write code. \n\nLet's take a look at our temperature program. Two main things jump out: we need the temperature in Fahrenheit, then we need to convert it to Celsius. Our outline would look like this:\n- Show temperature in degrees F\n- Convert temperature into degrees C\n \nWe can expound on those to get some logical steps:\n1. Create a variable with today's temperature (F)\n2. Print value to screen\n3. Convert to C\n4. Print new value to screen\n\nOnce we know the outline and think about the details, we actually have almost everything we need. All that's left is to write a few lines of code:",

In the first, we go outside wearing a coat. In the second, we go outside not wearing a coat.\n\n*If statements* and *else clauses* help us enable this decision making. What’s really happening? An evaluation of the condition that follows the if statement. If the statement is true, the computer will execute the instructions following `if`.
